# Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) Detection

This demo shows how to train a simple network to detect objects 'around corners' using a SPAD camera. It demonstrates how to do data capture using a realsense sensor, extract a position from a person detected in the image, and then train an MLP to detect the person's position from the SPAD data.
