### TMF8828

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the device location for the TMF8828 is set to
> `/usr/local/dev/arduino-tmf8828`. This is an atypical location, but makes it easier
> from the code side so we can just manually symlink the device to this location. To
> do this, run the following command:
> ```bash
> sudo ln -s <actual location> /usr/local/dev/arduino-tmf8828
> ```
